Code review action items:
1. Rework dataset prep + DrumSheetDataset so that each sample includes every bounding box for a page and split train/val per image. Right now each CSV row becomes a separate sample, so most glyphs in the image stay unlabeled background and identical pages leak into both splits.
2. Preserve category labels from prepared_data.csv when creating targets and train a true multi-class detector so label_to_midi mappings (and future ghost-note/rimshot support) become usable.
3. Make /parse_drumsheet auto mode gracefully fall back to OEMER when the detector raises HTTP errors (e.g., no detections) instead of returning 4xx immediately.
4. Relax the MusicXML parsing filter so percussion parts without explicit instrument metadata (common in OEMER output) still emit notes; otherwise parse_drumsheet returns an empty parsed_notes array for many XMLs.
5. Add regression tests for the MusicXML pipeline, dataset loader, and detector fallback paths so the bugs above stay caught.
